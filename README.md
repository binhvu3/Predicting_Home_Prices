## :bookmark_tabs: Abstract
For new home buyers, the process of purchasing a house and putting it in a bid could seem
daunting due to the price tag. The determination of the appropriate worth of a home could mean
the difference between thousands of savings or extra costs for the buyer. Additionally, knowing
the approximate worth of a potential house could give the buyer the confidence to bid for a
'dream house' that might seem outside of range otherwise. In this paper, a dataset containing
the house's physical characteristics (num bed, num bath, lot size, etc.), the external
environment (street, alley, neighborhood, etc.), and the transaction information (date sold, sale
type, sale condition, etc.) will be used. The goal is to predict the worth of house-based similar
features and identify which characteristics are the most impactful on home price.
